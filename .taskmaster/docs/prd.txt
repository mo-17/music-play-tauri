# Product Requirements Document: Cross-Platform Music Player

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a new cross-platform music player application. The application will be built using modern web technologies and packaged for desktop use across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The primary goal is to provide a beautiful, fast, and user-friendly experience for listening to local music files.

## 2. Target Audience
- Users with local music libraries (MP3, FLAC, WAV, etc.).
- Individuals who prefer a native desktop application over web-based streaming services.
- Users who value privacy and want to manage their own music collection.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. Core Music Playback
- Play, pause, skip forward, and skip backward controls.
- Volume control and mute functionality.
- Progress bar with seeking capability.
- Display of current track information: title, artist, album, and album art.
- Support for common audio formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, AAC, OGG).

### 3.2. Library Management
- Users can add one or more folders to their music library.
- The application will scan the specified folders for audio files and import metadata (tags).
- The library view should display all tracks, with options to sort by title, artist, album, or date added.
- Ability to search the library in real-time.
- Album art display in the library.

### 3.3. Playlist Management
- Create, rename, and delete playlists.
- Add tracks from the library to any playlist.
- Remove tracks from a playlist.
- View tracks within a playlist.
- Reorder tracks within a playlist via drag-and-drop.

### 3.4. User Interface & Experience
- A clean, modern, and intuitive user interface.
- A dark mode/light mode theme toggle.
- Responsive design that works well across different window sizes.
- Smooth animations and transitions.
- Native desktop notifications for track changes (optional).

## 4. Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Application Framework:** Tauri (v2)
- **Backend/Core Logic:** Rust

## 5. Architecture
- The user interface will be built as a single-page application (SPA) using React.
- State management will be handled with a suitable React library (e.g., Zustand or Redux Toolkit).
- All core application logic, including file system access, music file scanning, metadata parsing, and playlist management, will be implemented in Rust.
- Tauri will be used to create the desktop application, bridging the React frontend with the Rust backend.
- Communication between the frontend and backend will be done through Tauri's command system. Rust functions will be exposed as commands that can be called from the JavaScript frontend.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The application must be fast and responsive, even with large music libraries. Rust backend should handle heavy lifting efficiently.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** The application must build and run correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Security:** Follow Tauri's security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Data Persistence:** Playlists and library metadata should be stored locally on the user's machine (e.g., in a SQLite database or JSON files).

## 7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for v1)
- Integration with online music services (e.g., Last.fm scrobbling).
- Audio visualizer.
- Equalizer settings.
- Support for more audio formats.
- Tag editor for music files.
- Smart playlists based on rules.
